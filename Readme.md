### Archive

In the beginning no actual source control system was used. Instead there were multiple copies of folders in "[*Final*](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531)"-like manner. In April 2024 all that folder copies were migrated to git to preserve history the right way. More details about that in [archive/Readme.md](https://github.com/jurakovic/Comets/blob/archive/readme/Readme.md).
